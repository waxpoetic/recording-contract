[DATE]

### Summary:

This contract was developed after review of many different example and
real-world recording contracts, with a desire to make the entire process
not only more simple but also more open. It does not contain complex
legal terminology or large passages of unreadable, irrelevant text. We
have no desire to trick you into signing something you shouldn't have.
This contract is designed solely so that both the artist and the record
label know where the money is going in the event of a payout.

#### In short:

You ([ARTIST]) are releasing original music on Wax Poetic Records. We
choose the music to be released very carefully, and by signing this
document you are legally binding both yourself and Wax Poetic Records to
deliver on what is promised.

### What do both parties agree to do?

As a recording artist, you have the power and ability to enter into this
contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide
technically satisfactory audio recordings of your work, defined as the
ability to successfully pass a number of sound tests to ensure that the
work is of the correct loudness and amplitude to be played alongside
other releases on this label. You agree to review the finished product
prior to release, provide feedback if necessary and sign-off approval
in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound
by any dates that we set together. You also agree on the terms of payout
as described at the end of this contract.

We have the capability to boost the reach of your music past what you
may be able to do as a single recording artist. However, the responsible
use of the promotion channels accessible to us requires us to ensure
that any samples or copied material contained in the work have been licensed
for use in a derivative work. This is especially true in the case of
open-source releases, which can not contain any samples since the
licensing of said samples would change by virtue of the package it's
contained in.

###Getting down to the nitty gritty

####What we need from you

Below is a list of items we’ll need up front from you. Every project is slightly different, so there may be things we’ve missed from this list, but we will let you know as soon as we’re able if we’ve forgotten something we need.

* [LIST OF NEEDS] *includes credentials, access to any necessary services or assets, etc*

####Browser Compatibility
We have agreed to test our code in IE7+ as well as the latest releases of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. Additionally we test on mobile Safari and mobile Chrome (iOS devices, Android devices). If you need browsers other than those listed tested, please provide us with a list of the browsers and devices. Testing additional browsers requires more testing time as well as potentially needing to code for that specific browser.
We code everything with progressive enhancement in mind. This means that modern browsers may show slight differences to older browsers (such as text and box shadows, rounded corners, etc) based on what a browser is able to render. Any changes will not affect the user experience.

####Testing
We write tests before we write our code, which allows us to make sure that all required functionality is not only present, but works no matter how often we change things around. If your employees or other contractors will be working on the project along side us, we require that they also write tests for all code they produce to make sure we are all on the same page and not stepping on each others toes.

####Version Control
Git allows us to keep track of all changes that happen in your application. This way, if a bug is introduced we can quickly find where it was added and roll back to the previous bug-free state while we fix things up! We require code be under version control so we can work on your application with your employees or other contractors without worrying that we may be undoing or overwriting each others changes.

####Timeline
This project is scheduled to begin [START DATE] and will last a [PROJECT DURATION].
Below is the milestone schedule:

* [MILESTONE NAME, # DAYS REQUIRED]

This contract will be declared complete when all work completed has been paid in full.

####Additional development
Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract which we will be happy to provide upon request. We retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document.

####Contact
All communications will be made during regular business hours (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm CST, excluding holidays) and we will return any contact requests within one business day unless we notify you ahead of time that we will be out of the office. Of course we understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case of one know that our hours will be billed at time and a half. We appreciate communication in a text-based medium, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. We’re happy to speak to you on the phone, over Skype/Google Hangout, or in person if you are in the [MY CITY] area, keeping in mind that any decisions that are made will be written down and require your written approval.

As we value your time as well as our own, we ask that all meetings be scheduled a minimum of two business days in advance and be accompanied by an agenda so that we can be fully prepared. If we are unable to attend a meeting at your suggested time, we will be happy to provide two times that will work for us. Meetings must start and end on or before the time allotted and will be charged for whether you attend or not.

####Project Management
If you do not have a preferred project management tool, we will provide you with a login for ours where you will be able to see the status of the project down to the specific task, so you will always be kept up to date. We’ll be relying on you to participate by answering our questions, stating your approval, requesting changes, and verifying completeness through the tool as well. We ask for a one business day turnaround time on responses so we can keep things moving along at a pace that will allow us to hit the milestones we decided on together. 
To keep the project organized and the management of it easier, we prefer not to communicate any of the information stated above over ordinary email.

###Legal stuff

Although we test extensively, we can't guarantee that the functions contained in any application will always be error-free and so we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this application and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Phew.

####Copyrights

You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs,
trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the release
are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

We own any graphics and other visual elements that we may create for you for this
project. Most releases have some form of imagery attached to them, and
if you wish to allow Wax Poetic to create the artwork related to your
album, we will subsequently own any image likeness created for the
project.

You own any music, graphics or other visual elements that you have
created for this project (either prior to the signing of this document
or afterward). In keeping with the theme of this document, basically
anything you create for this project is still owned by you, and anything
the label does for it is owned by the label, with the exception of the
music itself wherein the label takes a small cut of all purchases.

### Payment

Now it's time to get down to the real reason why this contract was
created: monetary disbursement. In accordance with our distributor,
**Baseware**, we are given financial reports at the end of each month
showing how much money came in from track sales as well as streaming
audio on sites like Spotify and Rdio. We will forward relevant financial
information to you as it becomes available to us, with a detailed list
of the tracks you've released and how much they've made during this
report. Also in accordance with our distributor, we can not disburse
funds until the track has made at least $200. Please note that we
ourselves are not allowed to take out that money, so it's not like we're
keeping your cash or anything, we don't have it either!

Tracks are sold on Beatport for **$1.49**, everywhere else for
**$0.99**, and are available on streaming sites for free. The
distributor, **Baseware**, takes 50% of this and the subsequent revenue
is paid back to Wax Poetic Records. Wax Poetic will take 25% of this net
revenue and pass the rest on to the artists who have signed this
document.

### But where is all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone
else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be
renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract
$is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of Pennsylania courts.
