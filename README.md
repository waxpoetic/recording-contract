### Summary:

This contract was developed after review of many different example and
real-world recording contracts, with a desire to make the entire process
not only more simple but also more open. It does not contain complex
legal terminology or large passages of unreadable, irrelevant text. We
have no desire to trick you into signing something you shouldn't have.
This contract is designed solely so that both the artist and the record
label know where the money is going in the event of a payout.

#### In short:

You ([ARTIST]) are releasing [RELEASENAME] on Wax Poetic Records. We
choose the music to be released very carefully, and by signing this
document you are legally binding both yourself and Wax Poetic Records to
deliver on what is promised.

### What do both parties agree to do?

As a recording artist, you have the power and ability to enter into this
contract on behalf of your company or organization. You agree to provide
technically satisfactory audio recordings of your work, defined as the
ability to successfully pass a number of sound tests to ensure that the
work is of the correct loudness and amplitude to be played alongside
other releases on this label. You agree to review the finished product
prior to release, provide feedback if necessary and sign-off approval
in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways and you will also be bound
by any dates that we set together. You also agree on the terms of payout
as described at the end of this contract.

We have the capability to boost the reach of your music past what you
may be able to do as a single recording artist. However, the responsible
use of the promotion channels accessible to us requires us to ensure
that any samples or copied material contained in the work have been licensed
for use in a derivative work. This is especially true in the case of
open-source releases, which can not contain any samples since the
licensing of said samples would change by virtue of the package it's
contained in.

### Getting down to the nitty gritty

A lot of this is actually dictated by our distribution company and
companies used as infrastructure to support the promotion of your work.

#### What we need from you

The only thing that is needed from the artist is
technically-satisfactory audio files in WAV format, at 16bit and
44.100kHz quality, as required by most retail stores and CD
manufacturers.

#### Copyrights

You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs,
trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the release
are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:

We own any graphics and other visual elements that we may create for you for this
project. Most releases have some form of imagery attached to them, and
if you wish to allow Wax Poetic to create the artwork related to your
album, we will subsequently own any image likeness created for the
project.

You own any music, graphics or other visual elements that you have
created for this project (either prior to the signing of this document
or afterward). In keeping with the theme of this document, basically
anything you create for this project is still owned by you, and anything
the label does for it is owned by the label, with the exception of the
music itself wherein the label takes a small cut of all purchases.

### Payment

Now it's time to get down to the real reason why this contract was
created: monetary disbursement. In accordance with our distributor,
**Baseware**, we are given financial reports at the end of each month
showing how much money came in from track sales as well as streaming
audio on sites like Spotify and Rdio. We will forward relevant financial
information to you as it becomes available to us, with a detailed list
of the tracks you've released and how much they've made during this
report. Also in accordance with our distributor, we can not disburse
funds until the track has made at least $200. Please note that we
ourselves are not allowed to take out that money, so it's not like we're
keeping your cash or anything, we don't have it either!

Tracks are sold on Beatport for **$1.49**, everywhere else for
**$0.99**, and are available on streaming sites for free. The
distributor, **Baseware**, takes 50% of this and the subsequent revenue
is paid back to Wax Poetic Records. Wax Poetic will take 25% of this net
revenue and pass the rest on to the artists who have signed this
document.

### But where is all the horrible small print?

Just like a parking ticket, you cannot transfer this contract to anyone
else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be
renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or
unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract
$is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of Pennsylania courts.
